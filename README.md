# Convert Image Black & White
This Python script converts a colored image to black and white using the Python Imaging Library (PIL). It opens an image file named `12.jpg`, converts it to grayscale, saves the resulting black and white image as `black.jpg`, and displays both the original and black and white images.

## Instructions:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the Python Imaging Library (PIL) if you haven't already. You can install it via pip:
   pip install Pillow
3. Download the `Convert_Image_Black_White.py` file to your local machine.

## Usage:
1. Place the image file you want to convert to black and white in the same directory as the script.
2. Rename the image file to `12.jpg`, or update the script to reflect the correct filename.
3. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   python Convert_Image_Black_White.py
  
## Output:
The script will generate a black and white version of the original image and save it as `black.jpg` in the same directory. It will also display both the original and black and white images.

### Note:
- Ensure that the image file is in a format supported by PIL (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
- Feel free to modify the script according to your requirements or integrate it into your projects.
